## Definition
An algorithm is a set of instructions used to solve a problem or perform a task.

## Algorithm Analysis
There are two important questions that need to be asked when analyzing an algorithm:
Q1: Is it correct?
Q2: What is the [[Time Complexity]]?

Each of these questions are comprised of their own sub questions:
1. Is it correct?
	- Does it produce the correct output for every possible input?
			To check if it produces a correct output for every possible input, you must:
				Identify the different types of inputs.
				Check if the condition for these inputs work.
	- Does it halt?
2. What is the [[Time Complexity]]?
	- This is in the form of [[Big-O Notation]]

To answer the question of "Is it correct?" we utilize a [[Proof]]. Proofs for if it produces properly and if it halts properly.

For "What is the [[Time Complexity]]?" we provide the [[Time Complexity]] of the program.
