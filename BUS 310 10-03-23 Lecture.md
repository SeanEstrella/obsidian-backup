## Why Business Plans Don't Work
### The number 1 most import thing
Personalization is everything
### Postal's Seed Deck and Story
#### What we are going to cover today
- Entrepreneurship = Experimentation
- Business Plans = Assumptions without proof
- business experiments = data driven decision-making
#### Postal.IO - 2019 Investor Deck
##### Vision Statement
Postal.io is an integrated direct mail platform for sales and marketing teams that leverages machine learning to automate and optimize the delivery and reporting of personalized physical assets in the sales process
##### Proven Founding Teams
Erik Kostelnik
- CEO/co-founder
- the thinker/the tester
Jed Danner
- CTO/ co founder
- The builder
Dusty Doris
- vp engineering
- the engineer, helps jed
... the rest is online for real
##### The Opportunity
###### No Direct Mail
B2B prospect and client engagement through physical assets is an antiquated, standalone, non-data driven process without a platform
###### Decreasing digital lead conversion
Based on ANA/DMA response rate report 2018, email response rate is decreasing with a 1% response rate with direct mail increasing average 9%
###### Lead gen is shifting
With Account Based Marketing (ABM) and sales automation technologies, lead generation is shifting from a marketing to a sales process
###### Increases digital privacy regulations
New regulations will impact the ability for sales and marketers to digitally advertise and engage online, sparking a resurgence of direct mail.
##### The Solution
An integrated intelligent B2B engagement platform that knows what physical assets to send, when to send, and who to send to
###### How it works
As response rates continue to fall and privacy regulations hinder marketers' ability to retarget prospects digitally, direct mail will be a integral resource for sales and marketers

Direct mail response rates more than double overall prospect conversion rates when integrated into the existing prospecting workflows of calls, emails, chat, digital ads, and text
##### Total Adressable Market
Postal will be implementing a multi level selling strategy to users, managers and executives in both the Sales and Marketing teams

The total addressable market of gloval users totals 42.7m
