# Limiting Behavior
## Definition
The behavior of a function as the function approaches its [[Limit]]. A limit describes the value that a function approaches when an input is given.

Typically, a limit is used to approach $\infty$ but can still be a regular number. If such a number is used, then it is the same as just evaluating a function with some value.
## Mathematical Notation
Find $\lim_{x\to\infty} f(x)$ when $f(x)=x^2+3$

$\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)=\infty$
This happens since as x increases in size, so does x^2 approach infinity
