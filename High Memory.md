# High Memory
## What is it?
- High memory, also known as "extended memory" or "upper memory," refers to the region of memory with higher addresses or locations. It starts from an address value higher than the boundary of low memory.
- High memory is typically used for user processes, applications, and data. It contains program code, data structures, and variables that are part of user-level applications.
- In modern computer systems, high memory can be quite extensive and can accommodate a wide range of user processes and data.
- High memory is managed and allocated by the operating system to execute user programs and provide space for user data. It is less constrained than low memory and can be utilized more flexibly.
