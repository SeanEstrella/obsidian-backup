# Time Complexity
## Definition
The time required by an algorithm to solve a given problem. Specifically, it quantifies the amount of time it takes for the [[Algorithm]] to run as a function of the length of the input.

In mathematical notation:
	The symbol $T$ represents Time Complexity and is a function
		Input: input size, $n$
		Output: [[Big-O Notation|O(n)]]
