# Defining Performance
## Execution Time

> [!definition]
> The total time required for the computer to complete a task including disk accesses, memory accesses, I/O activities, operating system over-head, CPU execution time, and so on.

Throughput (or bandwidth)
- Another measure of performance, it is the number of tasks completed per unit time
## Performance
### Performance via Response Time
- We can imagine performance through response time
- To maximize performance, we want to minimize response time:
$$ 
\begin{aligned}
Performance_{X} = \frac{1}{Execution\;Time_{X}}
\end{aligned} $$

### Relative Performance
- If computer A runs a program in 10 seconds and computer B runs the same program in 15 seconds, how much faster is A than B?
- We know that A is $n$ times faster than B if
$$ 
\begin{aligned}
\frac{Performance_{A}}{Performance_{B}} = \frac{Execution\;Time_B}{Execution\;Time_{A}}
\end{aligned} $$
# Measuring Performance
## CPU Time is a measure of computer performance
- Computer that performs same amount of work in the least time is the fastest in performance.
- Definition of Time:
	- wall clock time
	- response time
	- elapsed time
- Each of these terms means total time to complete a task.
	- This is CPU execution time, also just CPU time
### user CPU time
- The CPU time spent in a program itself.
### system CPU time
- The CPU time spent in the operating sysÂ­tem performing tasks on behalf of the program.
## Clocks, Cycles, and Periods
- Computers use a clock which determines when events should take place
- These time intervals are known as [[Clock Cycles]], other names are:
	- ticks
	- clock ticks
	- clock periods
	- clocks
	- cycles

> [!question] Definition: Clock Cycle
> The time for one clock period, usually of the processor clock, which runs at a constant rate


Length of a clock period can refer to two things:
1) The time for a complete clock cycle (e.g. 250 picoseconds, or 250 ps)
2) The Clock Rate (e.g., 4 gigahertz, or 4 GHz), which is the inverse of the clock period
# CPU Performance and Its Factors
## Examining Performance
> [!Tip] Equation
> Option 1: $$\begin{aligned}Execution\;Time_{CPU}=Clock\;Cycles_{CPU}\times{Clock\;Cycle\;Time}\end{aligned} $$
> Option 2:
>$$\begin{aligned}Execution\;Time_{CPU}=Clock\;Cycles_{CPU}\times{Clock\;Cycle\;Time}\end{aligned} $$

# Instruction Performance 
### Instruction Performance Equation
 
$$\begin{aligned}
\text{Clock Cycles}_{CPU}=\text{num of instructions}\;\times\;\text{average clock cycles per instruction}
\end{aligned} $$
- Clock Cycles per Instruction (CPI)
	- Average number of clock cycles per instruction for a program or program fragment
# Classic CPU Performance Equation
$$\begin{aligned}
\text{CPU time}= \text{Instruction Count} \times CPI \times \text{Clock cycle time}
\end{aligned}
$$
Or, since the clock rate is the inverse of clock cycle time:
$$\begin{aligned}
\text{CPU time}= \frac{\text{Instruction Count} \times CPI}{Clock\;Rate}
\end{aligned}
$$
