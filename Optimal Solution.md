## Definition
Refers to the fundamental concept in mathematics, computer science, operations research, and related field, particularly in the context of optimization problems. Essentially the best possible solution out of all feasible solutions, based on the given criteria or objectives.

## Characteristics of an Optimal Solution
1. **Feasibility**: The solution must be achievable and valid within the constraints of the problem. It adheres to all the rules and limitations defined in the problem statement.
2. **Optimality**: Among all feasible solutions, the optimal solution provides the best outcome according to the defined objective. This could mean maximizing or minimizing a certain value, like cost, time, distance, profit, efficiency, etc.
3. **Measurability**: The criteria for optimality are quantifiable. This allows for the comparison and evaluation of different solutions to determine which one is the best.

## Types of Optimization Problems
1. **Maximization**: Finding the maximum value. Examples include maximizing profit in a business, maximizing the output of a production process, or finding the longest path in a graph.
2. **Minimization**: Finding the minimum value. Common examples are minimizing costs, reducing waste, minimizing the time taken to complete a task, or finding the shortest path in a graph.
