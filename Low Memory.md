- Low memory is where the core system and operating system code and data are often loaded. It contains critical structures and data, including the kernel, device drivers, and system buffers.
- In terms of memory layout, low memory is located at the beginning of the address space and is generally reserved for the operating system and system-related functions.
- Low memory is essential for the proper functioning of an operating system, and it is typically protected to prevent unauthorized access or modification.
