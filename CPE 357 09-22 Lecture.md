CPE/CSC 357: Systems Programming

Systems vs. Application Programming
	Applications serve the users
	Systems Programs serve other programs and as such hidden from the user
		examples:
			Operating Systems
			Database Systems
			HTTP servers
6 planned programming assignment

There are Memory and Time constraints

## What is Systems Programming
- Term is used and interpreted in different ways
- Shared definition for the course:
	- [Systems Programming Languages](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0065245808605100) (Bergeron1 et al. 1972)
		- System Program:
			1. Broad problem, numerous subproblems
			2. Support other systems and applications
			3. Continuous use
			4. Continuously evolving features
			5. Disciplined communication between modules
	- [BLISS: A Language for Systems Programming](https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/classes/cs520/spring06/bliss.pdf) (Wulf et al. 1972)
	- [Systems Programming](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=542917) (Donovan 1972)    
	- Panel: [Systems Programming in 2014 and Beyond](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/events/lang-next-2014/panel-systems-programming-languages-in-2014-beyond)
		- Systems Programming is from when you had to deal with **Hardware**
